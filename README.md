# RoleBasedOnAccessControl
Creating a web application with authentication, authorization, and role-based access control using Spring Boot involves several steps. 
Core Functionalities:
1.Authentication: Allows users to register, log in, and log out. It ensures that only valid users can access the application by verifying their identity using credentials (e.g., email and password).

2.Authorization: Grants access to specific resources or actions based on the user's identity and permissions. This prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive areas or performing restricted operations.

3.Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Assigns roles (e.g., Admin, User, Editor) to users and maps permissions to those roles. It simplifies management by controlling what actions or resources a user can access based on their assigned role.

Features of the Web Application:
1.Registration Page: New users create accounts with details like email, password, and optionally a role.
2.Login Page: Authenticates users using their credentials and establishes a session or token.
3.Logout Functionality: Ends the session or invalidates the token, ensuring secure sign-out.
4.Role-Specific Access: Restricts certain routes, pages, or actions (e.g., admin-only dashboards, editor access to content management).

Technologies Used:
1.Backend: Frameworks like SpringBoot, Node.js, Django, or Flask for handling user management and session/token-based authentication.
2.Frontend: Frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js for creating intuitive registration, login, and restricted pages.
3.Database: Stores user data and roles, MySQL.
4.Security: Implements password hashing (e.g., bcrypt), JWT for token management, and HTTPS for secure communication.

For Setting up SpringBoot Project
I have created a Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) with the following dependencies:
1.Spring Web
2.Spring Security
3.Spring Data JPA
4.H2 Database (for simplicity, you can use any other database)
